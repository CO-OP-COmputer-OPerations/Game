Instructions: 

Welcome to the Linear Rock Game 

You can journey in 4 directions during your adventure: 

North, South, East and West 

Or alternatively you can use 

Up, Down, Right and Left 

When not currently in an interaction or event simply type  

“Go (North/South/East/West)” 

or “Go (Up/Down/Right/Left)” 

You will then travel to your chosen destination, unless of course your chosen direction includes non-linear territory. Which is extremely dangerous and cannot be traversed by players. 

Other interactions will be easy to engage with, most requiring a yes or no response (simply type y/n). 

Your goal is to beat the boss to get the gold. 

Good luck!
