## Instructions

Welcome to the Linear Rock Game!


You can journey in 4 directions during your adventure: 

North, South, East and West 

When not currently in an interaction or event simply type

“Go (North/South/East/West)” 

You will then travel to your chosen destination, unless of course your chosen direction includes non-linear territory. Which is extremely dangerous and cannot be traversed by players. 


Other interactions will be easy to engage with, most requiring a yes or no response (simply type y/n). 


Your goal is to get the linear rock to its linear home.
 

At any time, you can type options to reveal:
