# Text-Based-Console-Game

The topic of this project is that your submission should be a console-based text adventure game written in Java and should show an understanding of topics covered in Introduction to Programming COSC2511. 

Full creative control is with your project team, and the story line is completely up to you! You might be exploring an alien planet, attacking a castle, or trying to make your way out of a spooky forest. 

Let your imagination run wild!Your game environment should be based on a 5 x 5 grid layout (see visual example on page 3)and should have a minimum of 9 locations that a player can visit throughout the game. 

Your game must have a clear objective (to win the game), and potentially may have an alternate ending (optional) such as the player dying. Your game must include an inventory system allowing a player to pick up, carry, list and interact with a minimum of 5 items, and must include at least one interaction with a non-player character (npc).

Players must be able to navigate the game using a simple control system based on the four main points of a compass (north(n), south(s), east(e) & west(w)), and each time a location and any available items or interactions is visited a description of the location must be printed to the screen. Once an item has been picked up, or a foe vanquished, subsequent visits to that location must omit the item or npc from the description (or in the case of a slain enemy, change its state to dead in the description).


Your goal is to display an understanding of the following programming tools used throughout your game:<br/>
Exemplary coding etiquette showing good indenting, consistent block bracing style, data type and class naming conventions and appropriate use of comments<br/>
At least one text-basedmenu<br/>
User (player)input<br/>
Appropriate selection of and use ofvariables<br/>
Selection statements including switch, if, else if and nestedif<br/>
Iteration with the appropriate type ofloops<br/>
Use of randomnumbers<br/>
Arrays<br/>
Functions<br/>
Classes and methods
