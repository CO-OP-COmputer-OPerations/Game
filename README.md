## Instructions ##

*Welcome to the Linear Rock Game*

*You can journey in 4 directions during your adventure:*

*North, South, East and West*

*Or alternatively you can use*

*Up, Down, Right and Left*

*When not currently in an interaction or event simply type:*

*“Go (North/South/East/West)”*

*or “Go (Up/Down/Right/Left)”*

*You will then travel to your chosen destination, unless of course your chosen direction includes non-linear territory. Which is extremely dangerous and cannot be traversed by players.*

*Other interactions will be easy to engage with, most requiring a single world response.*

*Your goal is to beat the boss to get the gold.*

*Good luck!*
